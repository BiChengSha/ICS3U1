TO RUN:
1. Compile all .java files
2. Run Game2048GUI.java ONLY. Game2048GUI.java calls upon the 2 other .java files

TO EDIT GAME SETTINGS:
game_config.txt handles the winning instance. Default winning instance is when the 2048 tile is reached
gui_config.txt handles the images. All tile images are 50px by 50px in size and are named icon[TILEVALUE].jpg (eg. icon512.jpg). Header image is 216px by 150px and named iconLogo.jpg

<b>IMAGES ARE NOT PROVIDED IN THIS REPO AS I AM UNABLE TO FIND A WAY TO UPLOAD THEM</b>
